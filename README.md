# React Native Movie Watchlist App

A sample app build with [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). User can search for movies, view movie details, watch trailers, add movies to their watchlist and keep track of movies they've watched.

Movie data is provided by [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/), watchlist and watched movies data is stored to device. 

To be able to run this on an emulator make sure you have followed [React Native getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and have a [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) key.

``` js
// src/api/config.js

export const TMDbApiKey = <your-API-key>
```

This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
